Non-functionals
===============

Performance
-----------

.. todo::
   
   Performance is not measured yet.

Coding style
------------

We've defined a relatively strict coding style, and have committed to also convert existing code and new changes to this format.

Testing
-------

We use Google Test. Tests are already operational, but could use some more structure. More tests would be nice.

macOS support
-------------

We have lots of troubles for macOS, mostly related to the ability of specifying the random generator.

Continous Integration
---------------------

At first, we misunderstood the requirements related to CI. These requirements are relatively in Jenkins, but our Git Workflow (which we're very fond of) is thightly integrated with Travis.

As a solution, we've properly divided the build and run steps, and provided a much cleaner job log that gives you an instant overview of what tests failed.

Documentation
-------------

We host the documentation, for both the report and the user manual, on readthedocs.io. Since our documentation will rarely get printed, it makes sense to focus on web first, and pdf second. However, readthedocs.io still provides pdf's.

We plan to eventually also put the reference manual (generated by doxygen) online.
