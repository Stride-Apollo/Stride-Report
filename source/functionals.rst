Functionals
===========

Here we'll discuss our progress for each functional requirement.

Population generator
--------------------

We had a rough start, since there was an inconsistency in the assignment. We wrote quite some code for this that was eventually not needed, since the assignment was changed.

After the change, we made reasonable progress and were able to implement all of the requested features. We finished quite early in the project and were able to use it during the development of multi region.


Checkpointing
-------------

Progress for this was rather consistent, until we had to write a ParaView plugin. Building and configuring ParaView turned out to be rather difficult.


Multi region
------------

We splitted this in two parts, as described in the assignment. The first version was a shared-memory implementation. We've almost finished this. However, we still have to decide on the configuration.

The second part, an MPI implementation, is planned later in the project.

TBB
---

We've already finished a prototype to familiarize ourselves with both OpenMP and TBB. The prototype also showed a small performance increase in favour of TBB.

Scientific visualisation
------------------------

We haven't really started working on this yet, except for some early exploration of the different technologies.
